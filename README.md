# run_analysis_project
Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera final project

This project is an excercise in collecting, working with and cleaning a dataset. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The project includes :
  1) a tidy dataset, labeled final_data.txt 
  2) an R script, named run_analysis.R, which runs the required operations:
       
       merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

       extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

       uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

       appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

       from the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  4) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
